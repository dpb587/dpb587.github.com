I am a *software engineer* who enjoys pushing the limits of *web technology* and applying them to *business processes*. Ideally, my job provides me with technical challenges that need *well-designed* solutions. I have a solid understanding of industry best practices, but I am more interested in *continuously learning* about why they exist and how they can be further *applied and improved*.
