I started this project after getting tired of manually managing certificates for the OpenVPN servers I managed. It was also really helpful for learning more about PKIs and better understanding how services rely on certificate-based authentication. I'm particularly proud of:

 * working through the broad implementations of user-authentication, certificate management, and service integrations.
 * adoption by several teams in my company to protect both development and production environments.
