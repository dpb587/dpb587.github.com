description: Curriculum Vitae with details of my professional experience and history.
---

I enjoy building technology to improve business processes as a software engineer. I build on industry best practices, but I use my detail-oriented and quick-learning nature to better understand how they can be adapted and improved for local needs. I bring my experiences as a developer, operator, and user to provide a more holistic perspective on solution discussions. I feel most effective when I can apply myself to evolving those solutions into something that will help others be more effective.

I look for technical opportunities that require me to learn and improve myself through complex problems and new perspectives. I want to work with teams that respect open source and appreciate open collaboration as a method to build effective products.
