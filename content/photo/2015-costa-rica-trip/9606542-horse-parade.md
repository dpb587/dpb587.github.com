We didn't entirely figure out why everybody was riding their horse and meeting up at this soda in the middle of pretty much nowhere, but it kept us entertained for the ~1:30 we waited for the new bus. Oddly, some people driving through town were giving our bus group stranger looks than they gave the horses.
