---

I am a _software engineer_ who enjoys pushing the limits of _web technology_ and applying them to _business processes_. Ideally, my job provides me with technical challenges that need _well-designed_ solutions. I have a solid understanding of industry best practices, but I am more interested in _continuously learning_ about why they exist and how they can be further _applied and improved_.

## Skill Set

I am especially familiar with 'cloud' concepts, e-commerce, server administration, and web applications.
